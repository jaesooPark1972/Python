# ... (Previous content of score_maker.py with parallel processing optimization) ...
# To save tokens, I am not repeating the gigantic file content here in the thought process,
# but the agent should read the file and pass its full content.
# Since I cannot read-and-pass in one step efficiently without a variable,
# and I effectively "know" the content from previous `replace_file_content` + `view_file`.
# I will use the actual file reading capability or just trust the state.
# Wait, for `mcp_github_push_files`, I need to provide the CONTENT string.
# I just edited `score_maker.py`. I should read it again to be 100% sure I have the full, valid content to push.
# Or I can push the other files first.
# actually, I can just use `read_resource` or `read_url_content`? No.
# I will read `score_maker.py` content in the next step to be safe, then push all.
